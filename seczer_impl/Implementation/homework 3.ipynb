    "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a type of policy gradient method for reinforcement learning that was used in the final training stage of GPT. In this homework, you will implement a highly simplified version of the PPO algorithm to get a foundational understanding of its mechanics. The aim is to outline the whole concept with mostly static components, to give you a birds eye view of how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The endresult is a model that learned that the reward model prefers positive words over negative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that there is quite a long path between this excercise and the real world application of PPO. However, since this is an introductory lecture and due to the vast diversity of the audience we will noo go into more depth.\n",
